# Project 2 Documentation
## Idea
  The goal of this assignment was to create a way for people to view pokemon card images and their general stats without having
  to look up individual cards on google. Getting data from the API was difficult at first but simple when I figured out what I was doing.
  After that it was all formating and deciding what information I wanted to remain on the site.
## Process
  I started with the idea and went from there. Getting rolling wa stough as I said before, but I slowly got in a groove. Once I got images of cards
  based on search IDs I was able to replicate that process to pull other information. The search by set feature was similar but required a
  loop to pull data out of a array in the JSON response. I added the ID display in the set search so users could search specific cards and
  see their stats.
## Resources
  I used the Milligram framework for the minimalist look of the site. It has column functionality that let me order the data display in a
  responsive and aestetically pleasing matter. The API I used was the Pokemon TCG API. My only complaint is you can't use it to search specific names,
  rather the ID codes provided by the API. I also used a color picker based on an image from the pokemon Anime series to select the color
  scheme for the site.
## Requirements and Grade
  I succesfuly satisfied the requirements. My three search features are the search box, the card vs set drop down, and the ID display dropdown.
  I also display the last search term properly. The site looks good and is responsive due to the milligram css framework. I did not repeat myself too much
  in the code and seperated all of my files into seperate formats. The code validates as well. I believe I deserve a grade in the 90s for this
  assignment.
