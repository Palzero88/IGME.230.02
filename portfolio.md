# Porfolio Documentation
## How I Did It
  Bootstrap was used to make this site. I had a modern single page theme in mind and implemented it as such. I used the jumbotron components and a carousel
to make everything big and easy to read. No additional typefaces were used and the colors were selected from a random theme picker. I learned
how to use Bootstrap with the documentation at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/.
## Features
  The site has a responsive layout that sports a navigation bar, about section, portfolio carousel, and contact information.
## Requirements
  I fulfiled the requirements of the assignment and opted to use Bootstrap to do so. I coded the page in such a way that it is extremely modular, and
  when I have a new project I'd like to show off, I can simply add it to the site with ease.
