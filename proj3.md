# Project Three Documentation
## Idea
  My goal for this project was to create a reaction game that was simple and within scope. In that I succeeded. The game functions and looks okay. Though I wanted it to look better, I simply did not have enough time.
## Process
  I started with a framework of circle blast to start this assignment. It reminded me what the syntax for certain things were and aided in creation of logical functions in the game. From there I added my assets and anything that I would need to make it visual. Then It was all the game loop. After that it was polishing and bug fixing until it was ready to upload.
## What Went Wrong
  My initial issue was in the game loop. It took me several hours to get it working with the functions I had defined and needed a full overhaul near the end. Then the FTP was giving me troubles and made me put the game a file level lower then needed. It was strange. All in all the game ended up about how I wanted it, but not really as polished as I hoped.
## Resources
  The resources I used were PIXI.js, Howler.js, and a sprite sheet that I edited for the specific stinks and fleas of the dogs in the game. I also used and edited the buttons from an assignment that we had done previously for a PIXI.js demo.
## Requirements and Grade
  I succesfuly satisfied the requirements. The game functions without error, and is a reaction game as I hoped. The dogs speed up as you continue and if they are close to you for too long you will lose. The buttons above function properly but could look better.
